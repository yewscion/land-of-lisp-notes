* Chapter 1
  These are my notes while working through the LoL book, interpersed
  with all of the code I copied during that work.

  Here's the example on the second page.

  #+begin_src lisp
    (+ 3 (* 2 4 ))
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 11

  The brief history outlines LISP as coming from a more mathematical
  background than a necessarily compsci background. John McCarthy
  created LISP in 1959. The goal was to make a programming language
  that was completely theoretical, but could produce elegant programs.

  It was apparently a fun project, nothing serious. Haha.


  #+begin_src lisp :results output
    (print "This File Contains")
    (print "Two Lines of Text")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 
  : "This File Contains" 
  : "Two Lines of Text" 


  #+begin_src lisp 
    (defparameter *small* 1)
    (defparameter *big* 100)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : *BIG*

  #+begin_src lisp :results output
    (print *small*)
    (print *big*)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 
  : 1 
  : 100
